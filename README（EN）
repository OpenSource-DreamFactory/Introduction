**Open Source Dream Factory (OSDF)**

**Overview:**
The Open Source Dream Factory (OSDF) is an open-source DAO organization aimed at conducting social experiments for open-source developers. Its goal is to establish a gateway from Web3.0 to the open-source world, encouraging developers to continually contribute code and time to open-source projects. We can create dynamic NFTs linked to open-source projects and contributor activities. Participants will compete to develop the most promising projects, using dynamic NFTs and DAO mechanisms to support open-source innovation.

**Vision:**
Build a vibrant open-source ecosystem that motivates developers and provides sustainable funding for open-source projects.

**Mission:**
Inspire more developers to contribute to open-source projects. Developers should be rewarded and recognized commensurately with their contributions. Provide continuous financial support to promising but underfunded open-source projects. Foster the development of an open collaborative culture. Innovate governance and incentive mechanisms within the open-source ecosystem.

**Problem:**
Most open-source projects rely on voluntary contributions from developers and lack sustainable and stable funding, making long-term development difficult. Additionally, developers lack the motivation and incentives to maintain their contributions.

**Opportunity:**
The OSDF project's opportunity lies in its technology and mechanism. Using innovative dynamic NFTs combined with DAO governance can attract the technical community's attention. Dynamic NFTs can gamify open-source contributions, enhancing community user participation and continually motivating developers to engage in open-source projects. Dynamic NFTs can publicly and transparently record each contribution on the blockchain, increasing project credibility and facilitating community oversight. NFT holders have voting rights within DAO governance, which addresses investor trust and encourages funding injection, creating opportunities for new business models.

**Solution:**
Using dynamic NFT protocols, create dynamic NFTs to incentivize open-source developers' contributions. Dynamic NFTs will closely link open-source project activities and contributor actions. Contribution rankings will be directly related to open-source project dividends. The NFT upgrade mechanism will dynamically upgrade based on project progress and user contributions, gamifying open-source contributions. Each open-source project corresponds to a DAO fund pool, implementing transparent and fair financial management, allowing investors and community members to understand fund flow and usage. The community and investors can participate in funding and decision-making for the corresponding open-source projects. Preferred cryptocurrencies can be used for fundraising, with payments and transactions possible on cross-chain platforms like Polkadot.

**Objectives:**
- Encourage and incentivize developers to contribute to projects.
- Inject continuous funding into open-source projects.
- Create an active open-source project ecosystem.
- Achieve DAO governance, allowing community participation in decision-making.
- Promote open-source industrialization, helping excellent open-source projects achieve industrialization.
- Connect open-source participants by integrating enthusiasts, project teams, and investors to foster collaboration in the open-source field.
- Provide open-source services, such as funding, technical support, and operational support.
- Build an open-source ecosystem, aiming to create a platform that integrates open-source projects, services, community, and economic models.

**Target Groups:**
- Open-source project developers and contributors.
- Investors interested in open-source projects.
- Supporters of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

**Market Strategy:**
- Promote the project in open-source communities like GitHub and blockchain markets like Ethereum and Polkadot to attract developers and investors.
- Issue dynamic NFTs closely linked to open-source projects and contributors to attract enthusiasts.
- Implement DAO governance mechanisms to attract community participation.
- Fund popular open-source projects, partnering with them for joint promotion to attract developer community attention.
- Form strategic partnerships with wallets, NFT markets, etc., leveraging their communities and traffic for project promotion.

**Market Appeal:**
- Combining popular blockchain concepts can attract developers and investors from the cryptocurrency and blockchain fields, generating market curiosity.
- The incentive mechanism brings an active community, effectively mobilizing developers' enthusiasm and increasing market influence and visibility.
- Sustainable project funding support through DAO governance fund pools enhances market attractiveness.

**Current Users:**
- Developers interested in open-source projects.
- NFT collectors.
- DAO and blockchain technology enthusiasts.
- Donors interested in supporting open-source blockchain projects.

**Dynamic NFTs:**
Dynamic NFTs are a crucial feature and mechanism but not absolutely necessary. The project's core goals are to incentivize developers and provide funding support. Various mechanisms, such as establishing foundations, community funding, and direct cash rewards, can achieve these goals without relying solely on dynamic NFTs.

**Benefits of Using Dynamic NFTs:**
- Increase technical value and innovation.
- Enhance gamification and community participation.
- Improve project transparency.
- Enable secondary market transactions.
- Serve as a consistent tool for DAO governance.

**Challenges:**
- High development complexity.
- High operational costs.
- Legal risks.

**Solution for Dynamic NFT Implementation:**
Using an oracle-based approach to synchronize external data to the blockchain. Chainlink and Tableland can achieve this.

**Project Components:**
- Dynamic NFTs: Create NFTs closely linked to project activities and contributors, with an upgrade mechanism based on project progress and user contributions.
- Contribution Evaluation: Develop fair, transparent contribution evaluation standards and provide tools for developers to upload and verify contributions.
- Chrome Plugin: Create a plugin for users to view and manage their NFTs, showing their contribution level and project progress.
- DAO Fund Pool: All ETH from NFT sales enter a fund pool, with usage decided by DAO member voting.
- DAO Governance: Design governance rules allowing NFT holders to participate in project governance.

**Technical and Operational Needs:**
- Choose suitable blockchain technology and development framework.
- Develop dynamic NFT and DAO fund pool smart contracts.
- Conduct security audits on all smart contracts.
- Develop data interfaces for developers to upload contribution data.
- Build and manage a community, promoting engagement.
- Execute risk management and regulatory strategies.
- Strengthen security defenses to prevent attacks and data breaches.
- Enhance promotion to increase user and investor participation.

**Roadmap:**
- Complete white paper and website: Within 1-2 months.
- Initialize DAO governance and fund pool: Within 2-3 months.
- First NFT issuance and airdrop: Within 3-4 months.
- First batch of funded open-source projects: Within 4-6 months.
- Increase project interactions: Within 6-12 months.
- Strategic partnerships and promotion: Ongoing.
- Continuously optimize and develop the project.

**Funding Types:**
- Cryptocurrency funding and investment.
- DAO governance funds.
- NFT sales and trading revenue.
- Angel and seed round investments.
- Strategic partner investments.

**Usage of Funds:**
- Improve DAO governance and fund management mechanisms.
- Support more high-quality open-source projects.
- Organize various activities and training sessions.
- Increase market promotion efforts.
- Expand the technical team.
- Establish deep partnerships.

**Long-term Development Plan:**
- Focus on long-term development trends.
- Establish robust risk management mechanisms.
- Continue building community culture.
- Emphasize user experience.
- Maintain high transparency.

By following this plan, the OSDF can grow its community, market influence, and technical capabilities, ultimately contributing more to the open-source and blockchain industries.
